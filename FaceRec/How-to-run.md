How to run:

cd ~/FaceRec
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
startxfce4


Place you video files inside the Video directory in FaceRec ('/FaceRec/videos/')


outside virtualbox, open ds_bodies, ds_faces in a text editor.


at the bottom of both scripts, you will find an execution of the function Produce.

Produce have 3 input parameters

1: boolean, is it video (True) - or is it a directory fill with pictures (False)
2: boolean, do you want to show the image that is being processed (True), for faster performance choose no (False)
3: Path to directory or directly to video, it depends on your first input parameter choice. If True then chose video file, if False choose folder containing images.


Go back to virtualbox,

open terminal inside virtualbox (xfce4)

cd /code
